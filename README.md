Autoboat
========
_Autonomous boat base station setup_

For use with autonomous (Pixhawk) MOKAI jetboat performing waypoint navigation.


Boat
----
For now, this is meant to control an autonomous (modified) MOKAI jetboat
capable of:

  * TODO: Manual and automatic (watchdog) kill
  * TODO: Remote start/stop
  * TODO: Operation with radio dropouts

The boat will be controlled by a Pixhawk with a Digi XTend radio link.
Potential expansion to Iridium satellite link in the future.

Off-the-shelf, the MOKAI boat is drive-by-wire. Once the boat arrives, we will
need to splice the Pixhawk into the control electronics.


Base
----
QGroundcontrol, usage TBD.
